 <h1> Thank you for the Interview</h1>
  <p>Dear Janet Farquhar,
  <br>
  <br>I wanted to write my follow-up interview letter on HTML code to display my HTML skills that I've learned since you called me for the interview yesterday. I know...not that great, but I learned this from the 'Introduction to HTML5 and Coding' beginner’s online course from the University of Michigan. I am on schedule to completing it before the end of the year. Thank you for your team of educator's time and insight on the student population of Bennie Dover Jackson Middle School. It was exciting to hear that the students have a deep desire to learn and how tight-knit the community is.
  <p>
After our conversation, I'm confident that my background in education and teaching will enable me to help fulfill the action plan set out in the 'Commissioner’s Network Turnaround Plan for BDJMS' and serve the community as the Technology Teacher. Please feel free to contact me if I can provide you with any further information or samples of my work. I look forward to hearing from you.
<br>
<br>-Sincerely<br>
Charles Natividad<br>
